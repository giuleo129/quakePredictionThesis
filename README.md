# Quake Prediction on Etna: A Multi-Parametric Deep Learning Approach

This thesis presents a data-driven framework for short-term earthquake prediction at Mount Etna, in collaboration with INGV, leveraging high-resolution geophysical datasets and advanced machine learning techniques, including deep learning.

## Objective
Investigate the potential of machine learning methods to analyze seismic and related geophysical signals, focusing on predicting local earthquakes during 2018, a period of intense volcanic activity.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Jupyter Notebooks  
- Deep Learning (LSTM networks)  
- Statistical modeling & Random Forest  
- Time-series data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Data visualization and reporting

## Methodology
1. **Dataset and Preprocessing:** Collected seismic, geophysical, and gas emission data; performed feature engineering and data cleaning.  
2. **Baseline Model:** Random Forest for initial predictive performance.  
3. **Sequential Model:** LSTM networks capturing temporal dependencies and nonlinear patterns.  
4. **Extended Architecture:** Multi-LSTM models for enhanced performance.  
5. **Evaluation:** Comparative analysis of model predictions to assess accuracy and robustness.
